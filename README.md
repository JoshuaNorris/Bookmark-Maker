# Bookmark-Maker

This is the first project I did for a class I am taking called "Scalable Software". This class is designed to prepare the students
for developing large scale projects, both indeividually and in teams. This project was completed by myself from a requirements
document another person in my class wrote. This allows a user to make bookmarks of articles and rate these articles as well as
categorizing them and it has the ability to view them as well.
